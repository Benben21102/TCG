# React Project

A React + TypeScript application that uses **react-scripts** and **Framer Motion** for animations.

> **Note:** This README documents the prerequisites and how to stand the project up with `npm` using the `package.json` bundled with the repo.

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** — `>= 18.x` (recommended)  
- **npm** — bundled with Node.js (use the npm that comes with your Node installation)

Check versions:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

Optional (recommended for local Node version management):

```bash
# Using nvm
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

---

## 🚀 Getting started (local)

1. Clone the repo (if you haven't already):

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
# installs dependencies listed in package.json
npm install
```

3. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser (react-scripts defaults to port `3000` unless the port is overridden).

---

## 📦 Available scripts

- `npm start` — Start the development server (hot reload).
- `npm run build` — Create an optimized production build (output: `build/`).
- `npm test` — Run tests with react-scripts (jsdom environment).
- `npm run eject` — Eject CRA configuration (irreversible).

---

## 🎞 Framer Motion

Framer Motion is included as an animation library (`framer-motion`). You can import and use it in your components:

```tsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

export default function Example() {
  return <motion.div animate={{ opacity: 1 }} initial={{ opacity: 0 }}>Hello</motion.div>;
}
```

---

## ⚠️ Common troubleshooting

If you encounter problems:

1. Verify Node & npm versions:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

2. Clear/install from scratch:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

3. Use `npm ci` in CI environments (if you commit a `package-lock.json`):

```bash
npm ci
```

4. If tests or the dev server fail, ensure `src/index.tsx` exists and your TypeScript setup is correct. If you upgraded Node/npm recently, try switching Node versions via `nvm`.

5. If you encounter dependency resolution or build errors, deleting `node_modules` and reinstalling (see step 2) often helps. For dependency vulnerability fixes, try:

```bash
npm audit fix
```

---

## 🔁 CI / Production

- Use `npm ci` for deterministic installs in CI (requires `package-lock.json`).
- Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
# then serve the build output with your static server of choice
```

---

## 🧩 Additional tips

- If you plan to migrate away from `react-scripts` in the future, consider Vite / Next.js for faster dev builds — but that is beyond this project's scope.
- Keep TypeScript and type definitions (`@types/*`) in sync with your React version to avoid type mismatches.

## 📄 License & Contributing

- Add a `LICENSE` file (e.g., MIT) if you plan to open-source the repo.
- Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` if you want contribution guidelines.
